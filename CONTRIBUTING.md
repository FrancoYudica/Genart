## Project Setup

If you’d like to run the project locally:

1. Install [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download) (preferably version 4.3).
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FrancoYudica/Genart.git
   cd Genart
   ```

3. Switch to the dev branch to ensure your contributions align with the development workflow:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   ```
4. Open the project in Godot.
5. Run the project using the Godot editor (F5) to ensure it works.

## Contribute Code

1. [Set up the project](#project-setup).
2. Make changes to the Godot project (e.g., GDScript files, scene setups).
3. Add or update tests if applicable.
4. Ensure your code is clean and follows naming conventions.
5. Commit using descriptive messages.
6. Open a pull request targeting the `dev` branch.  
   **Note:** All merges should be made into the `dev` branch. The `main` branch is reserved as the stable source code and should always reflect production-ready changes.

## Manage Issues and Pull Requests

If you'd like to help with project management, you can:

- Provide support by answering questions on issues.
- Label issues using descriptive tags (e.g., bug, feature-request, help-wanted).
- Review pull requests and provide constructive feedback.
